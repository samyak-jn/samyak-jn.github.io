### Hey!

I hope you all are doing well and are safe at home. These are tough times but I'm sure we all will get through this soon.

### One Year ago!

#### May 06, 2019:

A newbie was waiting for some unexpected results. But it was on the 6th of May last year when he received:

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/rejected_proposal.png" description="Rejection Mail from GSoC2019 :(" %}

Hence, I was rejected for the first time :). It was my initial year of open-source. Being a newbie, I didn't know much and had an imposter syndrome. I didn't know from where should I start and what to do. 

For what I saw, several of the newbies out there felt the same way before entering an organization. Some got through, while a few gave up. But here is the truth, giving up is never an option.

Instead of sitting back, the very next week, I introduced myself on the IRC channel #debian-diaspora (thinking I have nothing to loose). Back then, my **first open-source community was Debian**!
I kept contributing by taking one step at a time towards the team. I have written a little about my journey with Debian [here](https://samyak-jn.tk/my-journey-with-debian/).

### One year later, Here I am! :)

As the saying goes, "Taking rejection positively or negatively depends upon us. It's our perspective"!

#### March 15, 2020:

I was so worried to choose a project (thinking am I eligible enough?). 
I still remember, how on March 15th me and [utkarsh2102](https://twitter.com/utkarsh2102/) (for whom I'm always thankful :D) discussed about the project, and that was it. At the end of the day I messaged one of the mentors of the project, **cdesai**, asking if it was too late to start.

He politely replied, "Hello Samyak, it definitely **isn't too late** and if you're confused about anything at all, feel free to ask as many questions as you'd like".
He has been a positive motivator throughout the process. Thanks for reviewing my proposal and guiding me.
Then finally I joined the #debian-mobile channel, and started interacting and contributing to the team. 

Nothing was smooth in the beginning, but that happens with everyone, isn't it? No-one knows everything or anything from the starting, everyone adapts and start learning. That is one of the most important lesson I learned on my journey.

Me being anxious, overthinking, refreshing the mail and the dashboard twice and thrice
And, then came the result:

I feel proud to share that I have been selected in **Google Summer of Code, 2020** at **Debian**. 
Debian has been a part of my growth throughout, and working under the same org for the whole summer is something I always dreamt of. My project is [**Android SDK tools in Debian**](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2020/Projects#SummerOfCode2020.2FApprovedProjects.2FAndroid_SDK_Tools_in_Debian.Android_SDK_Tools_in_Debian). I'm still figuring out the work, will be soon on track :P

I am really lucky to be guided by my mentors. 
I finally got to meet them yesterday!
