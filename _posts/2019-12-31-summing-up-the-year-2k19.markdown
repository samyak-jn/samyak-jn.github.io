Heya,
<p>
<h3>2019</h3> has almost <b>waved adieu</b> \o/
<br>
<br>
It felt like it started a month before and here we are <b>welcoming the next decade</b>.
</p>
The year brought me with a <b>lot of experience</b>, some were worst to handle, and some were so good that they became a memory!
<br>
PS. This is gonna be a little bit wavy with the mood!
<p>
Initially this year, I was a <b>lost person</b>. o/
<br>
<br>
<b>Didnâ€™t know what was I up to? What I wanted it to?</b>
<br>
<br>
Starting a new year with a lot of thoughts in mind kinda made me frustrated and irritated, felt like a waste to me. I was unaware of the fact that <b>Where I should start things with? or what I'm gonna do next?</b>
<br>
PS. These questions stills haunt me.
</p>
<p>
People always praised me as the <b>Class topper</b>, but I never found pride in it, still a day before yesterday I asked a friend what is the thing that makes me look apart from folks, he said <b>"CGPA"</b>.
I was so lost with my technical stuff. I knew that coding normal problem can't lead me anywhere. The thing pissed me off. 
<br>
Do you know what <b>acts as a catalyst</b>?
<br>
 The people who have expectations from you, the people who look up to you, who think you can do stuff, but deep down you know the real truth.
</p>
<p>
So, I asked another friend who was struggled enough and kinda mentors to me, he told me about the beauty of <b>open-source, and GSOC</b>.
<br>
That was the <b>first step</b> towards entering a new family.
I am the type of person who either estimates too much from self or underestimates entirely, hard to find a medium barrier.
I <b>was hoping to get into summer of code</b>, and wasted my exams prep for it, but ended up at nothing, that was an expected but a major failure. To be frank, it<b> hit me hard</b>, but as they say, <b>it's never too late for something</b>. 
<br><br>
After a day or to, I turned to <b>Debian IRC</b> for the first time and met another <b>God Mentor Praveen</b>, he is a <b>Debian Developer</b> and has a cool nick as <b>Pirate</b>, never saw a person so polite and helps you with everything, he helped me in all ways and made me comfortable with the technical stuff. I made mistakes but two of these were always there to help and eventually, Debian became familiar to work with me, and I liked to turn on to IRC each day and contribute to it, haven't done anything significant enough, but yes trying! One of the things, I found happy and worth mentioning from this year.
<br>
And yes, From May to September 14th, on my <b>99th day of contribution</b>, I gave my <b>first talk at Mini DebConf, Goa 2019</b>. Finally, met Praveen in person. I was so conscious at the time what to say and what not to, but both Praveen and Utkarsh made things comfortable there, and yeah it was <b>Goa</b>(first time for boarding plane, for walking side of the beach, attending a tech conference and giving a talk.  
<br>
Wow, that was the happiest time from the whole year. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Hope to become like the two of them someday</b> :D
</p>
<p>
Coming back to college was a <b>major breakdown</b> from all the adventure and fun I had. And it's real pain in everything when college authorities never favor you for anything. I started to like a life alone, with <b>my sweet slows slongs </b>from Spotify and their ads.
<br>
The 15th of October came, the <b>birthday celebration was one of the best</b> in the past years.
<br><br>
After that things <b>started falling</b> so much, found me in a place where I was so so stuck and was overthink everything, legitimately and this is what became a big barrier, the biggest hindrance for acting on the plans. Got a bunch of close friends by my side for help.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, <b>the things that helped</b>?
<br>
Read the <b>biography of Steve Jobs</b>, it was so motivating and awesome. <b>Silicon Valley, Scorpion, and Mr. Robot</b> is something that has a whole different place.
Also, the ending month of the year brought me with <b> F.R.I.E.N.D.S. </b>any other fans?
It helped me to cope up with the semesterly major papers. 
<br>
Also worth mentioning, the semester made me realize the interest in <b>Computer Architecture!</b> The exams came like a thunderstorm and went away, leaving it's after effect. 
I almost lost one of the close people meanwhile, things are better off now.
<br>
<br>
Here comes another failure at the ending of the year, I would say, it was an <b>overestimation</b> to get an internship so that I can finally go out and live independently on my own. 
Former says the failure, hence the latter, No, I didn't get in.
<br><br>
But things haven't started to fall in my place yet, hope so the new decade will! 
<br>
Mom keeps saying, "Don't let <b>the fear of rejections</b>, or not achieving what you thought hinders your hard work, and whenever things are destined they will <b>keep up with the consistency of work</b>", and that what's I like to do.
</p>
Would like to thank my <b>family</b> for all the support and strength. Also, worth mentioning friends here, <b>Utkarsh, Nishtha, Ritambhra, Pratiksha, Best Brains, Amigos</b> and a bunch of the people who came into my life and went away, it was a worth experience.
<br>
<br>
Thanks to you for going through all this, and hope the new year of the new decade brings you lots of happiness, joy, and love.
<h5>Happy New Year and a new Decade!</h5>
`echo "Adieu, till next!!"`
