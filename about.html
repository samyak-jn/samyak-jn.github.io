<p>Hey!<br>
<br>This is <i>Samyak Jain</i>, a third-year undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering.
<br>I'm a newbie in the field of open-source but as they say, you are never late for anything, until you start to do it. I am loving the beauty of open-source immensely, as I dig deeper. There is so much to explore and learn.
Also, I started<i> Debian Packaging</i> three months back and is a part of<i> #debian-ruby team</i> right now, Debian has provided me with lots of knowledge and skill, and must that I haven't explored ten percent of it solely.
<p>Hope, to become <i>Debian Maintainer</i> :P someday!!</p>
Besides the technological domains, I love exploring things which makes me stand different from others (most of the time, it frustrates me and ends :P).
At last, I would like to say, there is very much to explore and we have to just take a step in. I'm trying to learn that and recommending to.

Please feel free to contact for any queries, at <a href="https://twitter.com/samyak__jn/"><u>Samyak Jain</a></u>.

With the hope to get inspired!!
